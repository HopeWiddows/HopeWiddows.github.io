       <section class="index_page_container_1">
        <p>Hiya! My name is Hope, and I am a student developer. Thanks for swinging by!</p><br>

        <p>My most recent working background was in the Social Services, I worked as a Residential Youth Worker. 
          It was always my dream job, and through all the danger and the heartbreak, I lived to get up every day and work with these amazing, 
          and often misunderstood young people.  </p><br>

        <p> As we all know, life doesn't always pan out like we thought it might, and the diagnosis of a chronic illness meant that I had to 
          step back from youth work. It forced me to take some serious time out, and focus on switching gears. I did A LOT of thinking, 
        A LOT of crying, and had A LOT of converstations about what I might do next.</p><br>

        <p>After a long, long year (Covid, am I right?) it occured to me that I really enjoyed trying to figure out what was "under the hood"
          when playing around with Stardew Valley mods. I spoke to a friend that recently moved from the art world over to the tech world (and was LOVING IT) and by 
          the end of that conversation, I knew I had stumbled upon my future.</p><br>

        <p>I immediately starting looking into all kinds of degrees, diplomas, bootcamps, anything that could teach me how to code, and code well! 
          It wasn't too long before I was enrolled and on my way to my new dream job! </p><br>

        <p>Learning to code has been such a fun experience, sure there's some challenges (okay, a lot of challenges...) but I find it absolutely thrilling to be 
          constantly learning and growing. I'm really excited about my future in this field and the joy of being in a state of constant evolution!</p><br>
